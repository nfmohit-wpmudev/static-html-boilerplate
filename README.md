### Description
This static HTML boilerplate is our go-to template when me or my team is developing a static HTML project. It has all the goodies built-in so that we don’t have to configure everything from scratch every time we start a new project.

### Use Cases
This is very simple and straightforward. Just cloning will provide you with a package to start an HTML project.

### Core Features

1. Uses Webpack for bundling all files and folders.
2. Supports SASS.
3. Outputs minified and combined CSS and JS assets.
4. Has built-in support for Bootstrap.
5. Has built-in support for FontAwesome.

#### Coming Soon

1. BrowserSync support for seamless development experience.

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/nfmohit-wpmudev/static-html-boilerplate.git`.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`.
3. Development script: `npm run dev`.
4. Build Script: `npm run build`.
5. Archive Script: `npm run archive`.
